                    The film marked Kumar's second directorial after Raja Rani (2013), whose success impressed Vijay to work with the director. 
                    Atlee came up with the script, which was an "emotional action thriller film" and a formal announcement was made in September
                    2014. After post-production works and a formal launch ceremony in June 2015, the film began production in Chennai during 
                    early July. The film was halted twice due to the Film Employees Federation of South India's strike and the heavy flooding 
                    in Chennai. In addition, poor climatic conditions in China meant that the team had to abandon their idea of filming 
                    sequences there and instead opted to shoot in Bangkok. Despite the difficulties, the film was completed within January 2016.
