                    The film was officially announced in January 2023 under the tentative title Thalapathy 67, as it is Vijay's 67th film 
                    as a lead actor, and the official title was announced a few days later. Principal photography commenced the same month 
                    in Chennai along with a sporadic schedule in Kashmir, which was again followed by another schedule held at the former

                    Manoj Paramahamsa and editing by Philomin Raj.
