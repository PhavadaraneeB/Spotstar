                    The film was wide released on 20 December 2019. Prior to its release, filmmaker Bosco Prabhu accused Mithran for 
                    plagiarising his story. In April 2020, the Madras High Court issued an interim order banning the film from television 
                    and streaming platforms, due to which it was taken down from Amazon Prime Video. The ban was lifted in May 2020 once 
                    the issue was resolved.[5] The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise directed towards the 
                    performances( particularly Arjun), cinematography, story, action sequences and themes, and criticism for its 
                    screenwriting, characterization and pacing.

                    P. S. Mithran after Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga (2013) and Irumbu Thirai (2018) respectively. All the songs were released as 
                    singles, before being released as an album. The lyrics for the songs were written by Pa. Vijay, G. Rokesh and rap versions 
                    were penned by Abby Simone and MC Sanna.
