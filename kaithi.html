                    Lokesh initially worked on two scripts after the success of Maanagaram (2017), which he scrapped working on due to issues 
                    regarding the extensive research and casting process, until he came up with a news article about an ex-prisoner's life. 
                    He initially wanted Mansoor Ali Khan to play the lead role, but during the writing process, Karthi was demanded to play 
                    the lead, with the scale of the budget being increased further. Principal photography began in December 2018, and was 
                    completed by August 2019. The film was entirely shot at night, without any daytime sequences taking place during the shoot. 
                    It is a songless film, with the background score being composed by Sam C. S. The cinematography and editing were handled by 
                    Sathyan Sooryan and Philomin Raj, respectively.
