                <td><p><strong>Karnan is a 2021 Indian Tamil-language action drama film directed by Mari Selvaraj, and produced by 
                    Kalaipuli S. Thanu. The film stars Dhanush, Rajisha Vijayan (in her Tamil debut), Lal, Yogi Babu and Natarajan 
                    Subramaniam. The film features music composed by Santhosh Narayanan, cinematography handled by Theni Eswar, and 
                    editing done by Selva R. K. Loosely influenced by the 1995 Kodiyankulam caste violence, the film features the 
                    titular character Karnan, hailing from a conservative background, fighting for the rights of his people.

                    After a brief-long pre-production work, the film was launched in January 2020, with the title Karnan was also announced. 
                    The film is mostly set in rural Thoothukudi district. Shooting of the film took place, following its launch, and was 
                    completed in December 2020; although production was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was theatrically released on 
                    9 April 2021 to critical acclaim. It was also one of the highest grossing Tamil films of 2021, although its theatrical 
                    run was abruptly ended due to restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic. Publications like The Indian Express named 
                    Karnan as one of the best Tamil films of 2021.
