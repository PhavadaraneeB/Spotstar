                    on screen, and that's the only positive factor in the film, which otherwise is full of ineffective one-liners, illogical 
                    scenes and exhausting dialogues and songs". Behindwoods gave it 2.0 out of 5, stating that "Mr. Local misses out on 
                    entertainment".
